I drew inspiration from **drkhrse**'s bezel and rebuilt it from scratch so I could customize it and just have some fun customizing my MM+.  

I also created a custom palette losely based on Harlequin's GB Shader:  
```
[General]
Background0=9675527
Background1=7309573
Background2=4680963
Background3=2444803
Sprite%2010=9675527
Sprite%2011=7309573
Sprite%2012=4680963
Sprite%2013=2444803
Sprite%2020=9675527
Sprite%2021=7309573
Sprite%2022=4680963
Sprite%2023=2444803
```
  
The 'DOT MATRIX WITH STEREO SOUND' text uses the **Futura** font.  
  
The PSD file can be edited to include a Nintendo logo, but that will also require the **Pretendo** font.
